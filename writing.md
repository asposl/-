The drawing illustrates an elderly father who is passed around like a "soccer ball" by his three sons and daughter, each standing in different positions as if guarding their own “goals”—symbolizing their families. This image reflects a pressing issue in modern society: despite having multiple children, elderly parents often find no one willing to take responsibility for their care.

Caring for elderly parents is a core tradition in Chinese culture, rooted in respect and gratitude. It is a duty that we owe to those who built the society we now enjoy and who raised us with their hard work. Not only is supporting our elders an expression of this respect, but it also sets a valuable example for our own children, who will one day care for us in return.

Reestablishing care for the elderly as a social norm is essential. By acknowledging our shared future of aging, we reinforce the importance of supporting our elders as a moral and societal responsibility.

I regret to inform you that I must resign from my position as an editor at Designs & Fashions due to personal reasons. After two months of working in this role, I have come to realize that the job does not align with my career goals and personal interests. While I have a passion for fashion, I find that my strengths lie in data analysis and studying trends, rather than simply presenting others' creativity. I would have
preferred to focus on exploring the patterns in fashion and guiding its
direction, rather than merely reporting on it.

I sincerely appreciate the warm welcome I received from you and the team when I joined, and I apologize for any inconvenience my departure may cause.

To whom it may concern,

I would like to offer financial support to a child in a remote area through Project Hope, inspired by the impactful work your organization has done to address educational inequality.

I would appreciate it if you could help me find a child currently in K-12 education, specifically a middle child in their family. Middle children often receive less attention, as parents tend to focus more on the eldest and youngest siblings. As a result, middle children may feel overlooked and are frequently expected to sacrifice for their siblings. By providing financial assistance, I hope to give this child something truly their own, allowing them to feel valued and supported.

Thank you for your dedication, and I look forward to your response.

The photos depict the intense popularity of the English soccer star David Beckham. Some fans go so far as to write his name on their faces or spend significant money to style their hair like his. With the development of our economy, such displays of admiration for celebrities have become common. While it’s normal to admire public figures, a better way to honor them is by learning from their qualities and allowing their positive traits to inspire us.

Idols should be more than symbols of fashion or fame. Rather than only mimicking their appearance or doing something extreme to show our admiration, we should view them as role models who inspire us to persevere in challenging times. For instance, my idol is Yuan Longping, the scientist who developed hybrid rice, helping to address China’s food security issues. He represents a spirit of innovation and service, and I am inspired by his dedication to make a meaningful contribution to society.

By embracing the spirit of our idols, we allow them to positively shape our lives. Instead of stopping at superficial imitation, we should let their values guide us, enabling us to make a real difference in the world.

The images illustrate two contrasting approaches to family education. In the first image, a father is relaxed and watching TV, shouting at his son to study hard. In the second, a different father is shown sitting at a desk, actively studying alongside his son, creating a supportive learning environment. The scene implies that setting a good example is more effective in motivating children than merely giving instructions.

This reflects the importance of modeling behavior in family education. Children often imitate the actions of their parents, who are their first and most influential role models. By demonstrating positive habits, parents can instill values such as diligence, responsibility, and curiosity in their children. In my own experience, my parents emphasized kindness and a love of learning, which have had a lasting impact on my life.

In conclusion, effective family education involves more than verbal guidance; it requires parents to lead by example. Actions speak louder than words, and when parents engage in the behaviors they encourage, they foster a more meaningful and lasting influence on their children’s development.

Dear club members,

As the chairman of our club, I’d like to host a reading session this week and recommend the science fiction novel *Foundation* by Isaac Asimov. The story explores a future history, beginning with the fall of the First Empire and the rise of the Foundation and the Second Empire. Asimov’s creativity makes this novel, written almost a century ago, feel as relevant as ever. You’ll be captivated by his vision of humanity’s future and the power of knowledge to shape it. I hope you’ll enjoy this timeless classic.

Looking forward to seeing you all at the session.

The drawing depicts a family dinner where each person is focused on their smartphone, ignoring those around them. This image highlights a significant issue in modern society: smartphones are diminishing people’s ability to communicate in real life. While they may send countless messages online, they struggle to engage in face-to-face conversation.

Face-to-face interaction is fundamental for building genuine relationships. Although some communication can happen through smartphones, the most respectful way to connect with others is in person. Only in face-to-face interactions can we observe body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice — all of which are essential for deepening relationships and understanding each other. These non-verbal cues are often lost in digital communication.

Smartphones will always be available, but the time spent with family and friends is limited and precious. We should put down our phones and engage more with those around us. By doing so, we can lead richer and more fulfilling lives, strengthening our bonds with the people who matter most.

Dear President,

With the popularity of video games, many students tend to stay in their dormitories instead of participating in physical activities. As the saying goes, “a sound mind in a sound body.” To encourage students to be more active, perhaps you could organize a sports event or introduce more group activities focused on enjoyment rather than competition.

The event should emphasize fun rather than intensity, so more students feel encouraged to participate. Additionally, making participation a graduation requirement may backfire, as some students may resist, and those with weaker health could risk illness.

Thank you for considering this suggestion. I look forward to your response.

The two pictures depict a heartwarming scene: thirty years ago, a young mother holds her daughter’s hand as they cross the road; now, the roles are reversed, with the grown daughter supporting her elderly mother. These images illustrate the cycle of life and the importance of gratitude, showing why we should take care of our parents as they age.

In traditional Chinese culture, caring for the elderly is rooted in respect and gratitude. It’s a duty we owe to those who built the society we live in and raised us through their hard work. Respecting the elderly and cherishing the young are two sides of the same coin. Children represent the future, and nurturing them is essential for tomorrow’s society. The elderly, on the other hand, represent our own future selves; treating them with respect reflects how we hope to be treated in our later years.

Reestablishing care for the elderly as a social norm is essential. By recognizing our shared journey toward aging, we reinforce the idea that supporting the elderly is both a moral and societal responsibility, fostering a more compassionate society for all.
